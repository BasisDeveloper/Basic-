# README

This is a library mostly just for myself and isn't perfect. I keep copying and pasting 
these files from project to project, so instead of doing that, I'm just going to make this 
a library which I can make a git submodule. In making this "Basic" library a submodule all updates 
will also be synced with all of my projects... even the breaking changes ðŸ˜‘...
 
This is Windows only... because ... It's just for me.

Probably should have looked up if you can use private repositories as submodule, but, eh...
